## Description

This is the WebApi component of our Relative Testing Solution which has 3 components

1. Front-end GUI 
2. Back-end Web Api **<< this repo is this component <<**
3. Crawl/Diff class library 

This Web Api currently has two endpoints, one that launches crawl tests and another that launches diff tests. These operations call logic from the Crawl/Diff class library.
